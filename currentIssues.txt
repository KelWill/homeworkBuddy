Current issues:

Paragraph and question navigation has some bugs, that I can go back and fix later

Mysql questions id might not go up to a big enough number.

Saving questions to database + generating something that can be used as a report for assignment

It'd be nice to have some more details on questions available on the database (i.e MC, FillBlank, ShortAnswer)
