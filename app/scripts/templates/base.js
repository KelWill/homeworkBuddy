          <h4>Effectiveness of homework?</h4>\
          <p>Have you ever had the feeling that the homework you\'ve created isn\'t helping students achieve? You\'re not alone, and <a href = "http://www.alfiekohn.org/teaching/HWach.htm">you might not be wrong</a></p>\
          <h4>Homework Bud is Different</h4>\

          <h4>Improve your teaching</h4>\
          <p>By being able to quickly see what problems and concepts students struggled with, you can tailor your lessons to greater effect.</p>\
          <h4>Reading isn\'t enough</h4>\
          <p>Just reading something is one of the worst ways to learn. Testing and checks for understanding improve student results dramatically.</p>\
          <h4>Grading shouldn\'t be your priority</h4>\
          <p>Grading stacks of homework is the worst. Homework Bud will grade all of your multiple choice questions for you, and let\'s you concentrate on the important stuff.</p>\
